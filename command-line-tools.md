# sydCreateDatabase

Usage: `sydCreateClinicDatabase <schema> <filename.db> <folder>`. It creates a database name *filename.db* associated with a folder where the images will be stored. The filename and the folder must be in the same folder. 

The database *filename.db* is a sqlite file that can be viewed or browsed with any database viewer, such as [sqlitestudio](http://sqlitestudio.pl) 

The schema is *StandardDatabase*. A schema define the list of tables the database contains. Other types of schema will be proposed in the future. Database schemas are plugin libraries that can be dynamically found in the `SYD_PLUGIN` folder.
