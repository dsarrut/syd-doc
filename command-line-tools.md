# Command line tools

All tools start with `syd`. Verbosity is managed by `-v` flag. You can increase the verbosity by increasing the number `-v1`, `-v2` etc ...

Most of the tools (except sydCreateDatabase) require a database, set by the flag `--db filename.db` or implicitly with the environment variable `SYD_CURRENT_DB`. 

Help for most of the tools may be displayed with the `-h` flag.
